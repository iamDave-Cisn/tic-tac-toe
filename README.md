# tic-tac-toe
project

This project was intended to show my understanding of one-dimensional array.
Each player move needed to be validated in case it was NOT a valid move. 
After each move, I checked if there was a winner or tie, if not, then the game continue with the next player. 

#future addition: I plan on adding an CPU as an option.
